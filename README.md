Jobeet with Symfony2
====================

This is a derivative work of the original <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/">Jobeet tutorial</a> by Fabien Potencier and Jonathan Wage for the Symfony2 framework.

It's being rewritten by SymfonyTuts, as an attempt to port the
Jobeet Tutorial to Symfony2, and it's not considered official
in any way.

I'm not related to Sensio Labs, and this tutorial is not part of any official
documentation (at least, not yet :) ).

It's not finished, far from it. It's still a work in progress. It's based on
Symfony Standard Edition PR7, and I will be updating vendors as new releases come
out.
