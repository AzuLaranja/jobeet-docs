Jobeet with Symfony2
====================

This is the documentation for the Jobeet Tutorial on Symfony2
created by SymfonyTuts.

It's an attempt to port the Jobeet Tutorial to Symfony2, and it's not considered
official in any way.

I'm not related to Sensio Labs, and this tutorial is not part of any official
documentation (at least, not yet :) ).

It's not finished, far from it. It's still a work in progress. It's based on
Symfony Standard Edition PR7, and I will be updating vendors as new releases come
out.
